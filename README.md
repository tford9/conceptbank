The Directory For Paper Organization and Ideas
The current version of the prototype has been developed with web browser based languages, in particular HTML, Javascript, JQuery, and D3.js. All supporting languages except HTML are dynamic and require a webserver to properly display the interface in a browser.

A simple python web server can be initiated via the command line using(depending on python version:
Python 2.x
> python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
Python 3.x
> python3 -m http.server 8080

Be sure to run the command from the root directory of the ConceptBank repository. 

html/concept.html is the main file.


Currently the code for the interface supports browsers using web protocols from IE versions greater than 9.0, and current versions of all other current browsers.
